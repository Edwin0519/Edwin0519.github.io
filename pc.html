							<p>Pic 1 : Assembling PC </p>
							<h3>Reflection</h3>
							<p>The PC assembly lab provided a hands-on learning opportunity that was exciting and interesting. This practical training helped me understand the inner workings of a computer and how the many components work together to create a fully functional machine.</p>
							<p>We started by identifying and managing the parts, such as the motherboard, processor (CPU), RAM, power supply, hard drives, and fans. As we proceeded the assembly, I learnt that need to proper handling to avoid damage, and the careful planning required while assembling each component.</p>
                            <p>This lab showed the importance of attention to detail and patience. It also improved my problem-solving skills, as I faced and solved different challenges during the assembly process. Overall, this lab stated the basic concepts I learnt in class, and I have more understanding in my skills to build and repair PCs in the future.</p>
