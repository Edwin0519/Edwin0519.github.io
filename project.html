							<h3>Reflection</h3>
							<p>This semester give me many important learning opportunities, especially for understanding the design thinking process. Working on projects such as the AI-powered traffic management system allowed me to enhance my problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork abilities. I also expanded my technical skills of programming, networking, and user interface design, all of this are necessary for my network security future.  </p>
							<p>To improve the learning experience, I suggest including more hands-on coding and prototyping sessions. Interacting with students from different schools can also come in unique ideas. Furthermore, involving industrial visits or guest lecturers would provide practical knowledge and assist reduce the gap between theory and real-world implementation.  </p>
                            <p>This course helped me improve as a network security student by improving my communication and problem-solving skills. Further more, I plan on getting Python, C++, and cybersecurity certifications, as well as participate in competitions and projects to gain practical experience. These experience has motivating me keep studying and contribute to the industry.                              </p>
